Platform Engineering Perspective:
‚Ä¢	Four pillars:
o	Abstraction (scaffolds, templates)
o	Standardization (CI/CD, GitOps-ready pipelines)
o	Self-Service (Backstage UI + plugins)
o	Observability (Prometheus + Grafana)

‚Ä¢	Training is designed to align directly with your TOC objectives. Each hands-on lab mapped to a core pillar of platform engineering ‚Äî including service scaffolding, CI/CD standardization, secure infrastructure, observability, and Backstage-based developer self-service. Labs  covers GitHub OAuth, CI/CD with security scans, click-to-deploy pipelines, metrics collection with Prometheus, dashboarding with Grafana, and TechDocs ‚Äî all within a IDP-powered platform. This ensures the team not only will learn the concepts but also implement a full-stack Internal Developer Platform (IDP) prototype, exactly as defined in the training scope.

‚Ä¢	Training fully aligns with the Platform Engineering Certified Practitioner (PECP) exam domains. Trainees will have hands-on exposure to platform foundations, Golden Paths, GitOps-based CI/CD, secure infra provisioning, observability, and internal developer portals via Backstage. Each lab maps directly to PECP core competencies ‚Äî including service scaffolding, SAST/DAST integration, policy enforcement, and TechDocs. With these real-world labs and architectural discussions, trainees are not only exam-ready but also equipped for immediate platform implementation in production environments.

DAY1 :

üéØ Goal: Establish a shared understanding of Platform Engineering, developer pain points, and set the foundation for building an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) with Backstage.
________________________________________
üß† Key Concepts
‚Ä¢	Platform Engineering 101 ‚Äì Core principles & benefits
‚Ä¢	Platform Engineering vs DevOps ‚Äì Why IDPs are the next evolution

Lab‚ÄØ1 ‚Äì Set up Backstage Developer Portal (Local/Cloud)	Install Backstage as the face of the IDP. Configure for local/cloud access.
Lab‚ÄØ2 ‚Äì Explore Backstage UI	Explore Service Catalog, TechDocs, and plugin architecture.
Lab‚ÄØ3 ‚Äì Add GitHub Pull Requests Plugin	Integrate the PR plugin and view repo PR metrics.
Lab‚ÄØ4 ‚Äì Register a Sample Service	Add a service with catalog-info.yaml into Backstage catalog.
