```

Platform Engineering Perspective:
•	Four pillars:
o	Abstraction (scaffolds, templates)
o	Standardization (CI/CD, GitOps-ready pipelines)
o	Self-Service (Backstage UI + plugins)
o	Observability (Prometheus + Grafana)

•	Training is designed to align directly with your TOC objectives. Each hands-on lab mapped to a core pillar of platform engineering — including service scaffolding, CI/CD standardization, secure infrastructure, observability, and Backstage-based developer self-service. Labs  covers GitHub OAuth, CI/CD with security scans, click-to-deploy pipelines, metrics collection with Prometheus, dashboarding with Grafana, and TechDocs — all within a IDP-powered platform. This ensures the team not only will learn the concepts but also implement a full-stack Internal Developer Platform (IDP) prototype, exactly as defined in the training scope.

•	Training fully aligns with the Platform Engineering Certified Practitioner (PECP) exam domains. Trainees will have hands-on exposure to platform foundations, Golden Paths, GitOps-based CI/CD, secure infra provisioning, observability, and internal developer portals via Backstage. Each lab maps directly to PECP core competencies — including service scaffolding, SAST/DAST integration, policy enforcement, and TechDocs. With these real-world labs and architectural discussions, trainees are not only exam-ready but also equipped for immediate platform implementation in production environments.
